💼 **Experience**

📌 Machine Learning Intern — STUDent Entertainments (2025)

Developed an AI-based automated audio/video editing pipeline.

Reduced podcast editing time from 5–8 hours to 30 minutes (≈90% reduction).

Built intelligent shot-switching using WhisperX, Demucs, and FFmpeg.

📌 AI/Cloud Trainee — Edunet Foundation (IBM SkillsBuild) (2024)

Trained ML models on IBM Cloud.

Built reproducible ML experiment workflows.

🧩 **Major Projects**
🔹**AI Podcast Editor — Automated Editing System**

Multi-camera podcast editing automation.

Features: audio separation, speech recognition, speaker detection, shot switching.

Tech: WhisperX, Demucs, FFmpeg, Hugging Face, Flask.


🔹 **Multi-Disease Prediction System + AI Chatbot**

Predicts Diabetes, Heart Disease, Parkinson’s, Brain Tumor, Skin Cancer.

Image and numeric-input based ML interface.

Tech: CNN, Scikit-learn, Streamlit, Python.

🔹 **Food Recommendation Engine — Eclat Algorithm**

Mining association rules from 10k+ orders.

Improved recommendation accuracy by 25%.

Deployed using Streamlit.


**AI Story Board Creator with Enhanced Story**
Storyboarding is a crucial but time-consuming step in filmmaking and animation. This project automates the storyboard creation process using Large Language Models (LLMs) and diffusion-based image generation models, transforming a plain-text story into a cinematically structured storyboard with visual clarity.

The system focuses on visual storytelling, not dialogue or literary writing, ensuring that every output is drawable, interpretable, and production-ready.

**Future Projects**
🧠 **AI-Powered Text-to-Video Creation Platform**
A production-grade, fully automated text-to-video pipeline that transforms preprocessed text into minimalist, pedagogically optimized PowerPoint slides, personalized voice-over narration using user voice cloning, and an on-screen AI avatar that explains the content — all without cameras, recording, or video editing.

Users can upload a ~10-second voice sample to generate a cloned, natural-sounding narration, while an AI avatar appears in the bottom-right corner of the video to guide and explain the presentation, creating a human-like presence without being on camera.

Designed for speed, semantic accuracy, and cognitive clarity, this system is ideal for YouTubers, educators, trainers, and content creators who want to produce engaging, faceless videos at scale.


A production-grade, automated pipeline for generating minimalist, pedagogically optimized PowerPoint slides and concise voice-over narration from preprocessed raw text.

This system is designed for efficiency, semantic accuracy, cognitive load management, and seamless multimedia integration, making it ideal for education, technical presentations, training materials, and content automation workflows.


🏆 **Achievements**

Selected for AWS AI Scientist Nanodegree (Top 1,300 globally).

Completed NPTEL ML Course (IIT Madras).

IBM Certifications in AI, ML, Watson Studio.

200+ Problems on LeetCode, 100+ on GeeksforGeeks.
